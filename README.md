Personal Light Streaming  
====================
####PLS  
  
Development of a personal web music streaming plateform.  
It has to be light enough to run on a Raspberry Pi with a web server (preferably Apache, and if too heavy, nginx).  

Demo available [here][demo].

 * CSS
 * PHP
 * JavaScript
 * Ajax without XML
  
  
Used add-ons

####Notes

* jQuery was not used that much because I didn't learn how to, so it's a bit of a mix between native JS and jQuery
